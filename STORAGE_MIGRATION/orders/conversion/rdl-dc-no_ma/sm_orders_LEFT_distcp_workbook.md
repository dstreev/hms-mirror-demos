## WARNING
Using the options `-dc` and `-rdl` together may yield some inconsistent results. __If the 'current' table locations don't match the table name__, `distcp` will NOT realign those directories to the table names.  Which means the adjusted tables may not align with the directories. See: [Issue #35](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/hms-mirror/issues/35) for work going on to address this.
